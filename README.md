1. Voice Commands: Interact with Jarvis using natural language voice commands.

2. Task Automation: Automate repetitive tasks like managing schedules, reminders, and alarms.

3. Search and Information Retrieval: Fetch information from the web, such as weather updates, news, or general queries.

4. Email and Messaging: Manage and send emails or messages through voice commands.

5. Media Control: Play music, videos, or podcasts using your preferred media applications.

6. Extensibility: Add custom modules or plugins to expand Jarvis's functionality.
